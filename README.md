                <h2 id="intro">Here's a timeline of Dr Borlaug's life:</h2>
                
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>

                <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br> 
                    thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth<br> Administration"
                </li>

                <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> Conservation Corps, 
                    helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
                </li>

                <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>

                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to<br> budget cuts. 
                    Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school<br> study under Stakman, 
                    who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent<br> plants.
                </li>

                <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. 
                    Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue,<br> 
                    DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and other applied science.
                </li>

                <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>

                <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br> pregnant wife, 
                    and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology<br> program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 
                    different strains<br> of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major<br> climate on Earth.
                </li>

                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br> American breed, 
                    creating a strain that responds well to fertalizer. It goes<br> on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.  
                </li>

                <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of 
                    wheat to the<br> Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a<br> rapidly expanding population</li>

                <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>

                <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their<br> maize and sorghum yields</li>

                <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>

                <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."<br>Argues that genetically modified 
                    crops are the only way we can meet the<br> demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not<br> inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically 
                    modifying plants<br> and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people<br> were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>

            </ul>
